# node-red-contrib-tuya-devices
Support for Tuya devices in SmartHome projects using [Node-RED](https://nodered.org/).  
The goal of the project is to allow using local devices supports Tuya in Node-Red

## Getting Started

Prerequisites: [Node-RED](https://nodered.org) installation. For details see [here](https://nodered.org/docs/getting-started/installation).

Install via npm

```shell
$ cd ~/.node-red
$ npm install node-red-contrib-tasmotas
```
then restart node-red

The Tuya devices are represented by config Nodes (single Node per device). The flow Nodes references a device node and can exists multiple times in different flows. It can be defined a project object to group and control all Tuya devices in the local network. The IP addresses of the devices will be detect automaticaly. If configured a cloud access the device capabilities will be downloded and cached localy.

## First steps
Insert Tuya manager node. 
In the manager config form:  
- Add new tuya-project. 
  In the project config form:  
  - set the name for the project
  - Add new tuya-cloud. 
    In the cloud config form:  
    - set the AccessID, AccessKey and Any deviceId (needed to recognise the userId and all devices mapped to the same user account)
    - optional can be set the Tuya cloud userId if known and a name for the config node

If the cloud configuration is correct and the manager node has received at least once a message with topic 'updateDevices' all mapped devices will be listed in the config. The device capabilities will be cached localy. With the plus button can be added a config node for every local device. This config nodes contains all setting nedded to use the device localy and can be selected in the configuration of the Tuya device nodes. 

## TODO
- flow examples
- write change log
